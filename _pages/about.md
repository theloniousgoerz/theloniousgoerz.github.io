Hi, 

My name is Thelonious Goerz and I'm a pre-doctoral research fellow at the Poverty and Inequality Research Lab [(PIRL)](https://otheramerica.org/article/pirl-launches-predoctoral-research-fellowship) at Johns Hopkins. I work on housing, education, and public policy research. Feel free to reach out and chat via email or twitter. 

I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.A. in Sociology and a minor in data science. My thesis explored the economic and demographic trajectories of Seattle neighborhoods with Light Rail Transit. Throughout that time I also contributed to the student [newspaper](http://www.dailyuw.com/), worked in the writing center, and developed my statistical skills. You can find my projects on my [github](https://github.com/theloniousgoerz).
