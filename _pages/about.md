I am a pre-doctoral research fellow in Sociology at the Poverty and Inequality Research Lab [(PIRL)](https://otheramerica.org/article/pirl-launches-predoctoral-research-fellowship) at Johns Hopkins University. Here, I work on research in the areas of housing, education, and social policy. 

In fall, I will be a Ph.D. student in Sociology and Policy Analysis and Management at the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.cornell.edu/) and the [Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. 

Prior to this, I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.A. and wrote a thesis exploring the economic and demographic trajectories of Seattle neighborhoods with Light Rail Transit.
