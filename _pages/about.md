Welcome! I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.cornell.edu/) and the [Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. 
I use demographic, causal inference, and computational methods to study historical and contemporary topics in the areas of racial stratification, residential segregation and diversity, and health. Currently, I am working on two projects: the first focuses on the causal effects of segregation on black-white longevity disparities; the second seeks to understand emergent patterns of skin tone stratification among white Americans.
I am an affiliate of the [Cornell Population Center](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/cpc/about/our-affiliates/), [Cornell Center for Social Sciences](https://socialsciences.cornell.edu/affiliates), and the [Cornell Center for the Study of Inequality](https://inequality.cornell.edu/affiliated-faculty-and-postdocs).

Previously, I was a pre-doctoral research fellow in sociology and economics at Johns Hopkins University. I graduated from the University of Washington, Seattle with a B.A. in sociology.

Please get in touch via email if you would like to connect (tlg95@cornell.ed).
