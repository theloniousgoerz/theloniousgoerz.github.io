Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Sociology and Public Policy at the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.cornell.edu/) and the [Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I am interested in the social origins and built environment causes of health and socioeconomic inequality. I apply a demographic perspective to these issues and use quantitative and computational methods. Previously, I was a pre-doctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins University. 

Prior to this, I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.A. and wrote a thesis exploring the economic and demographic trajectories of Seattle neighborhoods with Light Rail Transit.
