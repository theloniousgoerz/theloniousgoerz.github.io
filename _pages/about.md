Welcome! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.cornell.edu/) and the [Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I am a demographer interested in social stratification in urban contexts, particularly segregation, and its effects on population processes, particularly health and aging. Specifically, I am currently researching the relationship between residential, racial segregation and aging using a variety of different data. I use quantitative methods to study these topics and am especially interested in the using machine learning and survey methods to answer these questions. I am an affiliate of the [Cornell Population Center](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/cpc/about/our-affiliates/), [Cornell Center for Social Sciences](https://socialsciences.cornell.edu/affiliates), and the [Cornell Center for the Study of Inequality](https://inequality.cornell.edu/affiliated-faculty-and-postdocs).

Previously, I was a pre-doctoral research fellow in sociology and economics at Johns Hopkins University. I graduated from the University of Washington, Seattle with a B.A. in sociology.
