Hi, 

My name is Thelonious Goerz and I'm a pre-doctoral research fellow at the Poverty and Inequality Research Lab [(PIRL)](https://otheramerica.org/article/pirl-launches-predoctoral-research-fellowship) at Johns Hopkins University. I study on housing mobility, education, and demography.

I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.A. in Sociology and a minor in data science. My thesis explored the economic and demographic trajectories of Seattle neighborhoods with Light Rail Transit. You can find my projects and code on my [github](https://github.com/theloniousgoerz). 

Feel free to reach out and chat via email or twitter.
