This is an ongoing list of resources, books, and websites on programming, statistics, and computational social science that I have found useful while studying quantitative methods through formally and independently.

## Programming

-   [CSE 414 \@ UW](https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/cse414-22au/)

The vast majority of UW's CSE curriculum is available on Google sites or github which is an invaluable resource. CSE 414 is the intro to database management and SQL course which has all the lecture slides, homework, and solutions posted online for free. They are very well explained and accessibly introduced.

## Statistics

-   [Applied Linear Regression](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~qfsong/teaching/525/book/Weisberg-Applied-Linear-Regression-Wiley.pdf) by Sanford Weisberg

This book is a really great, compact guide on linear regression. It makes heavy use of matrix algebra but has a helpful guide and appendix to review basics. I read several chapters of this book in a graduate course at University of Washington.

## Mathematics

-   [A Mathematics Course for Political and Social Research](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691159171/a-mathematics-course-for-political-and-social-research) by Will H. Moore and David A. Siegel

This book provides a great structured introduction to common mathematical techniques used by social scientists. I think that it strikes a good balance between rigor and intuition and provided me with a good foundation and jumping off point for more advanced topics. The book also has great reference material in the appendices too.
