# Blog life. 

Hi there, as you may have seen from my overly dense bio, this is my academic hub where I will be addind (shortly) all relevant materials related to school, professional, programming related, and general stuff. 

Another lofty plan I have is to document my honors thesis research during the upcoming year. As I eagerly await for the academic year to start, I am doing literature review and working hard to crystalize my ideas. 

Another thing that I plan to upload soon are some of the research things that I have already done. I have written a few good papers, reported on some interesing stories, and am preparing a few things I have done for potential publication. I plan to add those preprints to this website as soon as possible. 

I also plan to share some thoughts and ideas that I have along the way as they come up, as well as writing resources, and advice. 

Anyway, this was a short post to basically keep me accountable.
